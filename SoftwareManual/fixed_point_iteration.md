# Fixed Point Iteration
Using a fixed point to approximate the roots

**Routine Name:**           fixed_pt_iter

**Author:** Michael A. Warren

**Language:** C++. This code can be used using a GNU C++ compiler (gcc)

For example,

    gcc fixed_pt_iter.cpp

will produce an executable **./a.exe** than can be executed. If you want a different name, the following will work a bit
better

    gcc -o fixed_pt_iter fixed_pt_iter.cpp

**Description/Purpose:** Using a fixed point to approximate the roots of a given function. This routine takes the a given function and evaluates it in relation to a modified version of that function in order to get the roots.

**Input:** <any inputs needed to make it work>

**Output:** <what, if anything, comes out of the routine>

**Usage/Example:**

<basic example>
<give the output of the exampled input, if needed>
