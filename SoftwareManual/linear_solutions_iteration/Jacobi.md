# Jacobi Iteration
This routine computes the system of linear equations using the Jacobi Iteration Method.

**Routine Name:**           jacobi

**Author:** Michael A. Warren

**Language:** Python. This code can be used using a Python compiler.

For example,

    python Jacobi.py

**Description/Purpose:** This routine computes the system of linear equations using the Jacobi Iteration Method. 

**Input:** This routine needs a square, diagonally dominant, symmetric matrix (A); the RHS of those system of linear equations (b), an array (x0), the ammount of tolerance (tol), and the max amount of iterations (maxiter).

**Output:** This routine returns the solution of the linear equations in the form of an array (x1).

**Usage/Example:**
