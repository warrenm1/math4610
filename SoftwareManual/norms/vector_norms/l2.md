# l2 Vector Norm 
Sums the absolute value of each squared value of each element of a given vector, then takes the square root

**Routine Name:**           v_l2_norm

**Author:** Michael A. Warren

**Language:** Python. This code can be used using a Python compiler

For example,

    python l2_v.py

**Description/Purpose:** This routine computes the l2_norm of a vector.

**Input:** This routine takes a vector

**Output:** This routine returns a value representing the l2 norm of the vector

**Usage/Example:**

	v = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-23]

	print(v_l2_norm(v))

Displays:

	27.073972741361768

**Implementation/Code:** The following is the code for v_l2_norm

	def v_l2_norm(v):
		sum = 0

		for i in range(len(v)):
			sum += (v[i])**2

		return sum**(1/2)
